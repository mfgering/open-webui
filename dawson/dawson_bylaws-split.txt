BYLAWS: Article VIII ; Section 5.13: hereof, or any Owner defaults under his obligations under the Declaration or these Bylaws and the Association incurs any additional costs and expenses as a result of such default, the Association shall have the right to levy a special assessment against such Owner for the purposes of defraying, in whole or in part, such costs or expenses. The Declarant, as the agent of the Association, shall collect from each initial purchaser of a Unit at the time of closing an "initial capital assessment" equal to twice the estimated monthly assessment for Common Expenses but not to exceed Five Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($500.00). Such funds shall not be considered advance payments of assessments. The Declarant will deliver the funds so collected to the Association to provide the necessary working capital for the Association. In addition, upon the expiration of the Declarant Control Period, the Declarant shall forward to the Association a contribution to the working capital fund, in the amount specified above, for each unsold Unit in the Condominium held by Declarant and, in that event, Declarant shall be entitled to retain as a reimbursement the working capital contributions ultimately made by the initial purchasers of such Units. Such funds may be used for certain prepaid items, initial equipment and supplies, organizational expenses and other start-up costs, and for such other purposes as the Executive Board may determine. Except for the permitted reimbursement of prepaid contributions referred to above, the Declarant may not use the working capital fund to defray any of the Declarant's expenses, reserve contributions or construction costs, or to make up any budget deficits of the Association during the Declarant Control Period.
BYLAWS: Article VIII ; Section 8.2: Payment of Common Expenses. All Owners shall be obligated to pay the Common Expenses assessed by the Executive Board pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.1 hereof at such time or times as the Executive Board shall determine. No Owner shall be liable for the payment of any part of the Common Expenses assessed against his Unit subsequent to a sale, transfer or other conveyance by him (made in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration and applicable restrictions of record) of such Unit. A purchaser of a Unit shall be jointly and severally liable with the seller for the payment of Common Expenses assessed against such Unit prior to the acquisition by the purchaser of such Unit without prejudice to the purchaser's rights to recover from the seller the amounts paid by the purchaser therefor.
BYLAWS: Article VIII ; Section 8.3: Collection of Assessments. The Executive Board shall assess Common Expenses against the Units from time to time, and at least monthly, in accordance with the allocations set forth in the Declaration. The Executive Board shall take prompt action to collect any Common Expenses which remain unpaid for more than thirty (30) days from the due date for payment thereof. The Executive Board shall notify the holder of the Mortgage on any Unit (of which it has notice) for which any Common Expenses assessed pursuant to these Bylaws remain unpaid for more than thirty (30) days from the due date for payment thereof and in any other case where the Owner of such Unit is in default with respect to the performance of any other obligation hereunder for a period in excess of thirty (30) days.
BYLAWS: Article VIII ; Section 8.4: Default in Payment of Common Expenses: Remedies. In the event of default by any Owner in paying to the Executive Board the Common Expenses as determined by the Executive Board, such Owner shall be obligated to pay interest on such Common Expenses from the due date thereof at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum together with all expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees (if permitted by law), incurred by the Executive Board in any proceeding brought to collect such unpaid Common Expenses. In addition, the Executive Board shall have the authority to levy a late charge on any assessment not paid within fifteen (15) days after its due date in the amount of five percent (5%) of the overdue assessment. The Executive Board shall have the nght and duty to attempt to recover such Common Expenses, together with interest thereon, and the expenses of the proceedings, including reasonable attorneys' fees (if permitted by law), in an action to recover a money judgment for the same brought against such Owner, or by foreclosure of the lien on such Unit in like manner as a deed of trust or mortgage of real property. The Executive Board shall also have the right to impose uniform late payment charges for delinquent Common Expense payments which charges shall be recoverable by the proceedings specified above. In the event of the failure of an Owner to pay any assessment imposed hereunder or any installment thereof for more than sixty (60) days after such assessment or installment thereof shall become due, in addition to the other remedies available under the Condominium Documents and the North Carolina Condominium Act, the Executive Board shall have the right to declare all other Common Expense assessments and installments thereof with respect to such Owner's Unit that are to fall due during the then current fiscal year of the Association to be immediately due and payable.
BYLAWS: Article VIII ; Section 8.5: Lien and Personal Obligations. All Common Expenses and special assessments provided for in this Article, together with the interest and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees (if permitted by law), as provided for herein, shall be a charge on and a continuing lien upon the Unit against which the assessment is made, which such lien shall be prior to all other liens excepting only (i) assessments, liens and charges for real estate taxes due and unpaid on the Unit, and (ii) all sums unpaid on Mortgages and other liens and encumbrances duly recorded against the Unit prior to the docketing of such lien. Such lien shall become effective when a notice thereof has been filed in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court of Wake County, North Carolina, provided such notice of lien shall not be recorded until such sums assessed remain unpaid for a period of more than thirty (30) days after the same shall become due. Such notice of lien shall also secure all assessments against the Unit becoming due thereafter until the lien has been satisfied. The lien for unpaid assessments shall not be affected by the sale or transfer of the Unit, except in the case of a foreclosure of a Mortgage, in which event the purchaser at foreclosure shall not be liable for any assessments against such Unit that became due prior to the date of acquisition of title by such purchaser. Such unpaid assessments shall be deemed Common Expenses collectible from all Owners of Units, including the purchaser at foreclosure. In addition, each Owner shall be personally liable for any assessment against his Unit. No Owner may exempt himself from such liability by nonuse or enjoyment of any portion of the Common Elements or by the abandonment or sale of his Unit.
BYLAWS: Article VIII ; Section 8.6: Foreclosure of Liens for Unpaid Common Expenses. In any action brought by the Executive Board to foreclose on a Unit because of unpaid Common Expenses or special assessments, the Owner shall be required to pay a reasonable rental for the use of his Unit and the plaintiff in such foreclosure action shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect the same.
BYLAWS: Article VIII ; Section 8.7: Abatement and Enjoyment of Violations by Owners.

Each Owner shall be responsible for all damages to any and all other Units and/or to the Common Elements that his failure to do so may engender. Except as is specifically provided in the Declaration, all maintenance, repairs and replacements to the Common Elements (unless necessitated by the negligence, misuse or neglect of an Owner, in which case such expense shall be charged to and paid by such Owner), shall be made by the Executive Board; provided, however, there is excluded from the provisions contained in this section any repairs necessitated by casualty insured against by the Executive Board to the extent the Executive Board receives insurance proceeds for such repairs.

In the case of an emergency, such right of entry shall be immediate whether the Owner is present at the time or not.
