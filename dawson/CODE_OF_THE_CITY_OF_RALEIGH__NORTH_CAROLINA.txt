FOREWORD
This Code of Ordinances for the City of Raleigh was originally provided by the North Carolina League of Municipalities as part of its services program. Technical staff assistance was provided by Public Research and Management, Inc., of Atlanta, Georgia, which was responsible for the organization, codification, indexing and printing of the Code. 
The Code consists of: 
The Charter, followed by a tabulation of all local acts affecting the City of Raleigh: 
The Code of Ordinances, which includes citations referring to the official source and date of original ordinances, and those without citations representing new ordinances. 
This Code is designed to serve as a complete compilation of ordinances and as a reliable reference guide. The parts, chapters and articles of the Code follow in logical order. The table of contents, the sectional analysis at the beginning of each chapter and the indices provided sufficient points of reference for all elements of the code. 
Supplements will be published to keep the Code current. The supplements are printed in loose-leaf form so that all new ordinances may be inserted on a regular basis. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 3, 3-82, the Code was published by the editorial staff of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. 
In 1993, the Code was republished in a new format, using the format of the 1992 Zoning Ordinance, included as Part 10, Chapter 2. This republication was under the supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation.

DIVISION I 
CHARTER1
ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sec. 1.1 SHORT TITLE.
This Act shall be known as and may be cited as "The Charter of the City of Raleigh." 
Sec. 1.2 INCORPORATION.
The inhabitants of the City of Raleigh, within the corporate limits as now established or as hereafter established by statute or otherwise as provided by law, shall be and continue, as they have heretofore been, a municipal body politic and corporate, under the name of "The City of Raleigh," and under such name shall have perpetual succession. 
Sec. 1.3 CORPORATE LIMITS.
The corporate boundaries of the City shall be those existing at the time of the ratification and effective date of this Charter and as the same may be altered from time to time in accordance with applicable laws and illustrated by a map on file in the Raleigh Municipal Building. In lieu of maintaining a written metes and bounds description of the corporate limits of the City, the City Council shall approve a map showing the then current corporate boundaries of the City and the electoral districts therein, from and after which time such map shall constitute the official map of the corporate boundaries and electoral districts of the City, as such map may be officially revised from time to time by appropriate action of the City Council. The Planning Director, in consultation with the Chief Engineer, shall draw the original map for City Council approval and shall revise such map as the City Council authorizes revisions thereto by appropriate action. From time to time, when additional territory shall have been annexed in accordance with law so as to become part of the municipal territory of the City of Raleigh, and from time to time when the electoral districts of the City shall have been revised and re-established in accordance with law, the official map of the corporate boundaries and electoral districts shall be revised accordingly and, as so revised, shall be presented to the City Council for appropriate action. Such revised map, when duly approved by the City Council, shall thereupon become the official map of the City of Raleigh and shall supersede all prior maps of the corporate boundaries and electoral districts of the City. All such prior official maps shall be preserved as public records and kept on file by the City Clerk, and shall be subject to public inspection during regular office hours. The latest official map, properly identified and bearing the certificate of the City Clerk evidencing its approval by the City Council and stating the date of such action by the City Council, shall be kept on file in the office of the City Clerk and shall be subject to public inspection during the regular office hours of the City Clerk's office. Copies of the official map reproduced by any method of reproduction that gives legible and permanent copies, when certified by the City Clerk, shall be admissible in evidence in all courts and shall have the same force and effect as the original map from which the copy is made. 
(S.L. 1955, Ch. 627, §1; H.B. No. 405, 4-24-59; S.L. 1973, Ch. 319, §1(a))
Sec. 1.4 FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
The form of government for the City of Raleigh shall be known as the "Council-Manager Government" and shall be as set forth in Plan D of Part 4 of Article 22 of Chapter 160 [Article 7, Part 2, Chapter 160A] of the General Statutes of North Carolina, as heretofore adopted by the electorate of the citizens of Raleigh, subject to the modifications set forth in this Act. All powers of the City shall be vested in an elective Council, hereinafter referred to as the "City Council" or as the "Council"; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to prevent the form of government of the City of Raleigh from being determined from time to time by a vote of the people of the City of Raleigh at an election as now or hereafter provided by law. 
Sec. 1.5 GENERAL RIGHTS AND POWERS.
The City of Raleigh is hereby vested with all the property and rights of property which now belong to the said municipal corporation, and the City of Raleigh shall have all the powers granted to municipal corporations and to cities by the Constitution and by the General Laws of the State of North Carolina and by this Act, together with all the implied powers necessary to carry into execution all the powers granted. The City may acquire real or personal property within or without its corporate limits for the government welfare, benefit or improvement of the City and its citizens, in fee simple or any lesser interest or estate, by purchase, gift, devise, bequest, lease, condemnation, dedication or otherwise, and may acquire, sell, lease, mortgage, hold, manage and control, such property, real or personal, as its interest may require and as shall be deemed advisable by the governing body of the City of Raleigh and as shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Charter and the General Laws of the State of North Carolina. The City of Raleigh shall have the power to adopt a corporate seal, to contract and be contracted with, to sue and be sued, and plead and be impleaded. Except as prohibited by the Constitution and the General Laws of the State of North Carolina or restricted by this Charter and other statutes applicable to the City of Raleigh, the City shall have and may exercise all municipal powers, functions, rights, privileges and immunities of every kind and nature whatsoever, as may be necessary, proper, or usually appertaining to municipal corporations. The enumeration of particular powers by this Charter shall not be deemed to be exclusive, and in addition to the powers enumerated herein or implied hereby, or appropriate to the exercise of such powers, it is intended that the City of Raleigh shall have and may exercise all powers which, under the Constitution and the laws of the State of North Carolina, it would be competent for this Charter specifically to enumerate. 
(S.L. 1967, Ch. 26, §1)
Cross references: For additional grant of general power, see §2.13; for enumeration of express powers, see §2.14. 
Sec. 1.6 PLATTING OF PROPERTY.
Should any property lying within the corporate limits as established by this Act be hereafter platted into blocks and lots, then and in that event the owners of said property shall plat and lay the same off to conform to the streets and lots abutting on same, and shall file with the City Engineer a correct map of same; provided, that in no case shall the City of Raleigh be required to pay for any of said streets, at whatever date opened; but when opened by reason of the platting of said property, at whatever the date platted, they shall become by such act the property of the City of Raleigh for use as public highways, and shall be cared for as such. 
Sec. 1.7 PROPERTY AND PROPERTY RIGHTS VESTED IN CITY.
All property, real, personal and mixed, of whatsoever character or description, and wheresoever situated, now held, controlled, or used by the City of Raleigh for any purpose, or which may hereafter be held, controlled, or used by said City, or which may have been vested in said City by virtue of any law of the State of North Carolina, and any and all judgments, liens, rights of liens, and causes of action of any and all kinds in favor of the City of Raleigh, shall vest in and remain and inure to the City of Raleigh, its successors and assigns, under this Act.

The government of the City and the general management and control of all of its affairs shall be vested in a City Council, which shall be elected as hereinafter set forth and shall exercise its powers in conformity to the provisions of this Act and the provisions of the General Statutes and laws of the State of North Carolina with reference to the powers, rights and privileges of municipalities wherein no provision has been made in this Act with respect thereto; provided, however, that the City Manager shall have the authority hereinafter specified.

Meetings of the City Council may also be held at any time when all the members of the Council are present and consent thereto. The City Council shall have the power at any regular, special or adjourned meeting of the Council to adjourn any such meeting to a specific date, hour and place set forth in the motion or resolution for adjournment and without further notice such adjourned meeting may be reconvened and held, and all action taken and matters transacted at such adjourned meeting shall be valid as if taken and transacted at the original meeting. 
(S.L. 1957, Ch. 970; S.L. 1959, Ch. 260, §1)

(S.L. 1967, Ch. 714, §1)
Editor's note: 1967 Session Laws, Ch. 714, §1, amended §2.7 of the Charter by deleting the words "or special privilege" which formerly appeared in the second sentence of the first paragraph after the words "of any franchise." 
Sec. 2.8 EFFECTIVE DATE.
All ordinances passed by the City Council shall become effective upon their adoption or at such time after their adoption as the City Council may specify. An ordinance annexing territory to the City of Raleigh may be made effective on a date subsequent to the date of its adoption. 
(S.L. 1957, Ch. 970, §2; S.L. 1959, Ch. 259, §1; S.L. 1979, Ch. 664, §2)
Amendment note: 1959 Session Laws, Ch. 259, §1, amended §15 of Ch. 1184 Session Laws 1949 by adding a proviso at the end of the section relating to the effective date of ordinances repealing other ordinances and of ordinances annexing territory; 1979 Session Laws, Ch. 664, §2, amended §15 of Ch. 1184 Session Laws 1949 by completely rewriting the section. 
Sec. 2.9 EXCEPTIONS AS TO NEWSPAPER PUBLICATION OF CODE OF ORDINANCES.
(a)	Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing section [2.8], ordinances establishing regulations for the construction of buildings, the installation of plumbing, the installation of electric wiring, or any similar construction code, and any other lengthy ordinances such as a zoning ordinance or a traffic code or a license tax ordinance or code, revised, rewritten and adopted as a code, need not be published in a newspaper as provided by §2.8 of this act, provided that the ordinance adopting any such code or lengthy ordinance shall prescribe that the ordinance or code shall be published in printed or mimeographed form for distribution. 
(b)	In lieu of making publication of any such ordinance or code referred to in this section in a daily newspaper published in the City of Raleigh, there shall be published in at least one (1) daily newspaper of general circulation in the City of Raleigh a notice describing the ordinance or code in brief and general terms and stating that the ordinance or code is available for public inspection at the office of the City Clerk and that such ordinance or code will take effect twenty days after such publication of the notice unless submitted to referendum, in which event it will not take effect unless approved as required by law. 
Sec. 2.10 RULE AS TO FINAL EFFECTIVE DATE.
Every ordinance, unless it shall specify another date subsequent to the twenty-day period following publication, shall become effective at the expiration of twenty days after such publication following final passage, as herein provided, or, if the ordinance be submitted at a referendum election, then upon a favorable vote of a majority of those voting thereon except as otherwise expressly provided by this charter or by the general laws of the State. 
Sec. 2.11 GRANTING OF FRANCHISES.
(a)	No franchise initially granted to any public utility regulated by the North Carolina Public Utilities Commission shall be effective until the question has been submitted at a general or special election to the qualified voters of the City and until a majority of those voting on the proposition have voted in favor of granting such franchise. Any renewal of any franchise granted a public utility as hereinbefore defined or the grant of a franchise other than to a public utility company regulated by the North Carolina Public Utilities Commission may be granted in the Council's discretion; provided, however, that any franchise granted without a vote of the people shall be subject to a referendum as provided in §24 of Chapter 1184 of the Session Laws of North Carolina, 1949, as amended except that the number of qualified voters required by §24(b) [2.16(b)] for purposes of this section shall be five per cent (5%) rather than ten per cent (10%); and provided further that any franchise which initially requires a vote to become effective shall not be subject to the referendum provided in §24 of Chapter 1184 of the Session Laws of North Carolina, 1949, as amended. 
(b)	In all elections upon the granting of franchises, whether said election is held pursuant to an initial grant or otherwise, the person, persons or corporation applying for said franchise shall deposit with the City Treasurer a sum which in the opinion of the City Council will be sufficient to defray the expenses of such election; provided that no franchise shall be granted for a longer time than 60 years from the date of the granting of such franchise. 
(c)	Every grant of any franchise or right, as hereinbefore provided, shall make provision, by way of the forfeiture of the grant or otherwise, for the purpose of compelling compliance with the terms of the grant, and to secure efficiency of public service at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of the property in good condition throughout the full term of the grant; and when the grant of any franchise or right is made, the City shall not part with the power to expressly reserve the right and duty at all times to exercise, in the interest of the public, full superintendence, regulation and control, in respect to all matters connected with the police powers of said City; and before any such grant of any such franchise or right shall be made, the proposed specific grant shall be embodied in the form of an ordinance, with all the terms and conditions that may be right and proper, including a provision for fixing a rate, fares and charges to be made if the grant provide for the charging of a rate, fares and charges; provided, that this act shall not modify any rights, privileges and franchises heretofore legally granted by the City to any person, firm or corporation; and provided further, that any and all rights, privileges and franchises that have been heretofore or that may be hereafter granted to or held by any person, firm or corporation in the streets, alleys, sidewalks, public grounds or places in said City shall, except when such imposition by the City is prohibited by any statute now or hereafter in effect, be subject to a tax by said City in such amount as the City Council may think to be just, separate from and in addition to the other assets of such person, firm or corporation, and in addition to a license tax; and the City Council may require the rendition and assessment thereof accordingly. 
(S.L. 1967, Ch. 915, §1)
Annotation: Kornegay v. Raleigh, 269 N.C. 155, 152 S.E.2d 186 (1967). Franchises not authorized by general law must conform to all procedures required by local law. 
Editor's note: Subsequent to this court decision, this Charter provision was amended by 1967 Session Laws, Ch. 915. 
Sec. 2.12 COMPENSATION AND ALLOWANCES PAID TO COUNCIL AND MAYOR.
The compensation paid to the members of the City Council and the Mayor for their services may be fixed, from time to time, by the Council as provided in G.S. 160A-64. 
(S.L. 1957, Ch. 341, §1; S.L. 1973, Ch. 319, §1(f))
Editor's note: Session Laws of 1965, Ch. 12, §1 which reads as follows: "Effective on the first of the month immediately following the ratification of this act [ratified February 26, 1965], the Mayor of the City of Raleigh shall receive an annual expense allowance of eight hundred dollars ($800.00) and the Mayor pro tempore of the City of Raleigh shall receive an annual expense allowance of three hundred dollars ($300.00)." 
"Effective on the first of the month following the ratification of this Act, the City Councilmen of the City of Raleigh shall receive an annual salary of seven hundred and fifty [dollars] ($750.00), payable in twelve (12) equal monthly installments," was enacted by the 1965 legislature without amending the Charter although §2 of the act repealed "laws and clauses of laws in conflict." 
Sec. 2.13 GENERAL MUNICIPAL POWERS.
The City Council shall continue under existing laws to have power to make and provide for the execution of such ordinances for the City as the City Council may deem proper not inconsistent with the laws of the land, and the City of Raleigh shall have all the powers granted to municipalities by the general laws of the State of North Carolina as the same may now or hereafter be enacted. 
Cross reference: For grant of power generally, see §1.5. 
Sec. 2.14 EXPRESS POWERS ENUMERATED.
In addition to the powers now or hereafter granted to municipalities under the general laws of the State of North Carolina, the City of Raleigh shall have the following expressed powers hereby granted to it: 
(1)Payment of legal indebtedness.

Amendment note: 1991 Session Laws, Ch. 843, §1, amended §22 of Ch. 1184 Session Laws 1949 by adding subparagraph (85). §2 of the act declared the provisions applicable only to contracts or agreements entered into prior to Dec. 1, 1993. 
(86)[Development funds.]
 The City Council may, as part of its land development ordinances, provide that in lieu of required street right-of-way improvements, a developer may be required to provide funds that the City may use for the construction of right-of-way improvements to serve the occupants, residents, or invitees of the subdivision or development and these funds may be used for improvements which serve more than one subdivision or development within the area. All funds received by the City pursuant to this paragraph shall be used only for development of right-of-way improvements, including design, land acquisition, and construction. However, the City may undertake these activities in conjunction with the Department of Transportation under an agreement between the City and the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The ordinance may require a combination of partial payment of funds and partial dedication of constructed improvements when the governing body of the City determines that a combination is in the best interest of the citizens of the area to be served.

Sec. 2.15 EXTENSION OF APPLICATION OF HEALTH, SANITARY AND PROTECTIVE ORDINANCES.
All ordinances, rules, and regulations of the City of Raleigh now in force, or that may hereafter be adopted by the City Council in the exercise of the police powers given to it for sanitary and health purposes, or for the protection of the property of the City, unless otherwise provided by the City Council, shall, in addition to applying to the territory within the City limits, apply with equal force to the territory outside of said City limits, within one mile in all directions of same, and to the right-of-way of all sewer, water, and electric light lines of the City, without the corporate limits, and to the rights-of-way, without the City limits, or any street railway company, or extension thereof, operating under a franchise granted by the City, and upon all property and rights-of-way of the City outside the said corporate limits and the above mentioned territorial limits, wheresoever the same may be located. 
Sec. 2.16 INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM.
(a)Power of Initiative.
The electors shall have power to propose any ordinance, except an ordinance appropriating moneys or authorizing the levy of taxes, and to adopt or reject the same at the polls, such power being known as the initiative. Any initiated ordinance may be submitted to the Council by a petition signed by qualified electors of the City equal in number to at least ten per centum of the registered voters at the last regular municipal election. 
(b)Power of Referendum.
The electors shall have power to approve or reject at the polls any ordinance passed by the Council, or submitted by the Council to a vote of the electors, except an ordinance appropriating money or authorizing the levy of taxes, such power being known as the referendum. Ordinances submitted to the Council by initiative petition and passed by the Council without change shall be subject to the referendum in the same manner as other ordinances. Within twenty days after the enactment and publication by the Council of any ordinance which is subject to a referendum, a petition signed by qualified electors of the City equal in number to at least ten per centum of the registered voters at the last preceding regular municipal election may be filed with the City Clerk requesting that any such ordinance be either repealed or submitted to a vote of the electors. 
(c)Form of Petitions; Committee of Petitioners.
All petition papers circulated for the purpose of an initiative or referendum shall be substantially uniform in size and style. Initiative petition papers shall contain the full text of the proposed ordinance. The signatures to initiative or referendum petitions need not all be appended to one paper, but to each separate petition there shall be attached a statement of the circulator thereof as provided by this section. Each signer of any such petition paper shall sign his name in ink or indelible pencil and shall indicate after his name his place of residence by street and number, or other description sufficient to identify the place. There shall appear on each petition the names and addresses of the same five electors, who, as a committee of the petitioners, shall be regarded as responsible for the circulation and filing of the petition. Attached to each separate petition paper there shall be an affidavit of the circulator thereof that he, and he only, personally circulated the foregoing paper, that it bears a stated number of signatures, that all signatures appended thereto were made in his presence, and that he believes them to be genuine signatures of the persons whose names they purport to be. 
(d)Filing, Examination, Amendment and Certification of Petitions.
All petition papers shall be assembled and filed with the City Clerk as one instrument. Within five (5) business days after a petition is filed, the City Clerk shall examine the petition papers to determine whether each paper conforms to the requirements set forth in paragraph (c) herein and whether the number of signatures on valid petition papers is prima facie equal at least to the minimum number required. In making his examination, the City Clerk shall declare any petition paper entirely invalid which lacks any one of the following items; viz: The text of the proposed ordinance or the identification of the ordinance upon which a referendum is asked, the names of the committee members responsible for the petition, or the affidavit of the circulator. If a petition paper is found to be signed by more persons than the number of signatures certified by the circulator, the last signatures in excess of the number certified shall be disregarded and the City Clerk shall clearly indicate the cutoff point. If a petition paper is found to be signed by fewer persons than the number certified, the Clerk shall indicate the actual number of signatures. If the number of signatures on the valid petition papers shall be less than the number necessary, the City Clerk shall issue a certificate addressed to the committee of the petitioners setting forth the particulars in which the petition is defective. The committee shall be allowed ten business days to amend their petition by filing additional petition papers, but in no case shall any invalid petition paper be returned to the committee for perfection. In the event an amendment is filed, the City Clerk shall determine within five business days whether the petition as amended is now sufficient. If he find it still to be insufficient, he shall file his certificate to that effect in his office and notify the committee of the petitioners of his findings and no further action shall be had on such insufficient petition. Provided, however, that the finding of the insufficiency of an initiative petition shall not prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same purpose. If the City Clerk find the petition to be prima facie sufficient, he shall deliver the same to the Wake County Board of Elections for a checking of the names of the signers against the registration books. The board of elections shall complete its check within fifteen business days; provided, however, that the said board shall not be obligated to conduct a check in any thirty-day period immediately preceding, or in any ten-day period immediately following, a County-wide or City-wide election. In making its check of names, the said board shall be bound by the finding of the City Clerk as to validity of any particular petition paper and shall follow the rules set out above concerning petitions found to have different numbers of signers than those stated in the affidavits. Upon the completion of its check, the board of elections, through its Chairman or other duly authorized official, shall certify the outcome to the City Clerk. This certificate shall state (1) the total number of registered voters at the time of the most recent regular election of the members of the City Council, [(2)] the number of voters registered in the City of Raleigh whose names appear on the petition papers that the board found it necessary to examine, and [(3)] whether or not this number is sufficient for the submission of the proposed issue or issues to popular vote. If it was found unnecessary to check all names on the petition papers, this fact shall be indicated in the certificate. The petition papers shall be returned to the City Clerk by the County Board of Elections together with its certificate. 
(e)Certification of Sufficient Petition; Effect on a Referendum Petition of Certification.
Upon receiving the certificate of the Wake County Board of Elections, the City Clerk shall prepare a final certificate indicating the result of the board's examination and shall submit this certificate to the next regular meeting of the City Council. Whenever a referendum petition, or amended petition, has been certified as sufficient by the City Clerk, the ordinance specified in the petition shall not go into effect until and unless approved by the electors, as hereinafter provided. 
(f)Consideration by the City Council.
Whenever the City Council shall receive an initiative or referendum petition certified to be sufficient by the City Clerk as provided in paragraph (e) hereof, it shall proceed at once to consider such petition. A proposed initiative ordinance shall be read and provision shall be made for a public hearing upon the proposed ordinance. The Council shall take final action on the ordinance not later than sixty days after the date on which such ordinance was submitted to the Council by the City Clerk. A referred ordinance shall be reconsidered by the Council and its final vote upon such reconsideration shall be taken not later than the second regular meeting of the Council following the certification and shall be upon the question, "Shall the ordinance specified in the referendum petition be repealed?". 
(g)Submission of Ordinance to Electors.
If the Council shall fail to pass an ordinance proposed by initiative petition, or shall pass it in a form different from that set forth in the petition therefor, or if the Council fail to repeal a referred ordinance, the proposed or referred ordinance shall be submitted to the electors not less than thirty days nor more than one year from the date the Council takes its final vote thereon. The Council may, in its discretion, and if no regular election is to be held within such period shall, provide for a special election. Provided that, in case the Council shall pass an ordinance proposed by initiative petition in a form different from that set forth in the petition, the initiative form of the ordinance shall be submitted to the electors of the City only if, within twenty business days after the passage and publication of the ordinance in different form by the City Council, an additional petition signed by qualified electors of the City equal in number to at least five per centum of the registered voters at the time of the last regular municipal election is submitted to the City Council. The same rules that governed the filing, examination, amendment and certification of the original petition shall apply to the additional petition. 
(h)Form of Ballot for Initiated and Referred Ordinances.
Ordinances submitted to vote of the electors in accordance with the initiative and referendum provisions of this charter shall be submitted by ballot title, which shall be prepared in all cases by the principal legal adviser of the City. The ballot title may be different from the legal title of any such initiated or referred ordinance and shall be a clear, concise statement, without argument or prejudice, descriptive of the substance of such ordinance. The ballot used in voting upon any ordinance, if a paper ballot, shall have below the ballot title the following propositions, one above the other, in the order indicated: "FOR THE ORDINANCE" and "AGAINST THE ORDINANCE." Immediately at the left of each proposition there shall be a square in which by making a cross (X) the elector may vote for or against the ordinance. Any number of ordinances may be voted on at the same election and may be submitted on the same ballot, but any paper ballot used for voting thereon shall be for that purpose only. If voting machines are used, the ballot title of any ordinance shall be presented in such manner as to permit the elector to vote for or against the ordinance. 
(i)Result of Election.
If a majority of the electors voting on a proposed initiative ordinance shall vote in favor thereof, it shall thereupon be an ordinance of the City. A referred ordinance which is not approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon shall thereupon be deemed repealed. If conflicting ordinances are approved by the electors at the same election, the one receiving the greatest number of affirmative votes shall prevail to the extent of such conflict. 
(j)Publication, Amendment, and Repeal of Initiative or Referendum Ordinances.
Initiative and referendum ordinances adopted or approved by the electors shall be published and shall take effect as do other ordinances. Such initiative or referendum ordinances may be repealed only by vote of the electors of the City. The City Council may request the Wake County Board of Elections to submit a proposition for the repeal of any such ordinances, or for amendments thereto, to be voted upon at any succeeding general City election; and should any such proposition so submitted receive a majority of the votes cast thereon at such election, such ordinance shall thereby be repealed or amended accordingly. 
(k)Restrictions on Use of Initiative Process.
The initiative process shall not be used to reverse the result of a referendum until one (1) year shall have passed since the referendum vote or the effective date of the referred ordinance, whichever shall be the more recent. Nor shall the same question be submitted to the voters twice in the same twelve-month period. 
(l)Use of Initiative Process To Repeal an Existing Ordinance.
In the event the initiative process is used for the purpose of the repeal of an existing ordinance, the petition shall set out the ordinance the repeal of which is sought, and a vote shall be had only on the question of the repeal of such ordinance. If such process is used for the purpose of the repeal of a part of an existing ordinance, the vote shall be had only on the question of the repeal of that part of the ordinance set out in the petition.

Sec. 4.2 RECALL OF OFFICIALS BY THE PEOPLE.
The holder of any elective office may be removed at any time by the electors qualified to vote for a successor of such incumbent. The procedure to effect the removal of an incumbent of an elective office shall be as follows: 
(1)	A petition signed by electors entitled to vote for a successor to the incumbent sought to be removed, equal in number of at least twenty-five (25) per centum of the entire number of voters casting votes at the last preceding general municipal election, demanding an election of a successor of the person sought to be removed, shall be filed with the Clerk, which petition shall contain a general statement of the grounds on which the removal is sought. The signatures to the petition need not all be appended to one paper, but each signer shall add to his signature his place of residence, giving the street and number. One (1) of the signers of each such paper shall make oath before an officer competent to administer oaths that the statements therein made are true as he believes, and that each signature to the paper appended is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. Within ten days from the date of filing such petition, the City Clerk shall examine and from the voters' register ascertain whether or not said petition is signed by the requisite number of qualified electors, and he shall attach to said petition his certificate showing the results of such examination. 
(2)	If, by the Clerk's certificate, the petition is shown to be insufficient, it may be amended within ten days from the date of said certificate. The Clerk shall, within ten days after such amendment, make like examination of the amended petition, and if his certificate shall show the same to be insufficient, it shall be returned to the person filing the same; without prejudice, however, to the filing of a new petition to the same effect. 
(3)	If the petition shall be found to be sufficient, the Wake County Board of Elections shall order and fix a date for holding a primary, as provided for in cases preceding regular municipal elections, the said primary to be held not more than sixty days from the date of the Clerk's certificate to the Wake County Board of Elections that a sufficient petition is filed. If in the primary election any candidate receives a majority of all the votes cast, he shall be declared to be elected to fill out the remainder of the term of the officer who is sought to be recalled. If there be more than two candidates in such primary, and no one receives a majority of all the votes cast therein, then there shall be an election held within twenty days from the date of the primary, at which election the two candidates receiving the highest vote in the primary shall be voted for. Candidates named shall be placed on the ticket in the primary and election held and the results canvassed, under the same rules, conditions, and regulations as are prescribed for the primaries preceding a regular municipal election in the City of Raleigh. 
(4)	The Wake County Board of Elections shall make, or cause to be made, publication for ten days of notice and all arrangements for holding such election, and the same shall be conducted, returned, and the results thereof declared in all respects as other City elections in the City of Raleigh. The successor of any officer so removed shall hold office during the unexpired term of his predecessor. Any person sought to be removed may be a candidate to succeed himself, and unless he requests otherwise in writing, his name shall be placed on the official ballot without nomination. At such election, if some other person than the incumbent is elected, the incumbent shall thereupon be deemed removed from the office upon qualification of his successor. 
(5)	In case the person elected should fail to qualify within ten days after receiving notification of election, the office shall be filled by election by the City Council, but the officer or councilor removed shall not be eligible to election by the City Council, and the person so elected by the City Council shall be subject to recall as other officers and councilors. If the incumbent received a majority of votes in the primary or the election, he shall continue in office. The said method of removal shall be cumulative and additional to any other method provided by law. The expense of calling and conducting any such election shall be paid by the City of Raleigh.

(b)	In the case of removal of residence of any officer elected to represent a specific electoral district from the electoral district for the representation of which he was elected, such removal shall, ipso facto, create a vacancy in his office. 
(S.L. 1953, Ch. 347, Art. 2; S.L. 1973, Ch. 319, §1(m))
Sec. 4.4 OCCURRENCE OF VACANCIES.
(a)	All vacancies in elective offices shall be permanent and shall occur upon the death, removal or residence, other disqualification (such as that associated with a violation of the law), or disability of the elective office holder. For this purpose, a person shall be deemed to be disabled if, as a result of the certification of a physician, or as a result of an independent investigation by the City Council, it determines that a member is too infirm, either physically or mentally, to discharge his duties adequately and consistently. A member shall also be deemed to be disabled when he fails to attend six (6) consecutive regular meetings of the City Council. 
(b)	A person appointed to fill a vacancy on the City Council, due to disqualification or disability, shall be clothed with all the authority and powers given under the laws of North Carolina to such office; but the officer so chosen, shall be subject to recall as any other officer.

Wherever any of the foregoing shall exist, then the City Planning Commission may make recommendations as to their respective removal, relocation, widening or extension, as occasion may suggest or necessity require. 
(f)	The City Council shall have power at any time to request the City Planning Commission to give an opinion and make recommendations upon any matter pertaining to the powers and duties of the City Planning Commission. 
(g)	Before any new street is opened, or any existing street is extended, or before any new subdivision for residence, business or industrial uses is made, the person or persons opening such street or proposing such new subdivision for residence, business, industrial or other purposes shall submit a detailed plan with blue prints and other necessary data to such City Planning Commission. It shall be the duty of said commission to carefully examine the plans for such subdivisions as regards their nature and purpose, the number, width, character, and location of streets and alleys, and the size, material, and manner of laying of water mains and sewer lines; and transmit such application, with all data, to the governing body, with its recommendations in writing. The jurisdiction of such commission concerning the regulation of subdivisions shall extend one mile beyond the corporate limits of the City. The commission shall have the right to make recommendations for the correction, widening, or relocating of any interior street to the governing body. 
(h)	The City Council is hereby authorized and empowered, but shall not be required, to make provision in the City budget and to make appropriations for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section. 
(i)	The City Council, in its discretion, is hereby authorized and empowered in the exercise of the police powers of the City, to pass and adopt and to amend and/or repeal all ordinances and resolutions, and to do all things necessary, to carry out the recommendations that may be made by the City Planning Commission, under the provisions and powers of this section, where not contrary to law. 
(S.L. 1973, Ch. 319, §1(t))
Sec. 6.39 ZONING REGULATIONS.
(a)	For the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the City, the City Council is hereby authorized and empowered by ordinance to regulate and restrict the location, height, bulk, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures, the per centage of a lot that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts, and other open spaces, the density of population and the location and uses of buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry, business, residence or other purposes, including off-street parking of vehicles. Such ordinances may provide that the board of adjustment may, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate principles, standards, rules, conditions and safeguards set forth in the ordinance, make special exceptions to the terms of the zoning regulations in harmony with their general purpose and intent. Such ordinances may provide that the board of adjustment may authorize variances from the strict application of the regulations in such situations and subject to such limitations as may be set forth in the ordinance. 
(b)	For any and all said purposes and under a comprehensive plan, the City Council may divide the municipality into districts of such number, shape and area as may be deemed best suited to carry out the purpose of this section; and within such districts the City Council may regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair and use of buildings, structures, and land. All such regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of building throughout each district, but the regulations in one district may differ from those in other districts; however, the City Council may provide for the creation of conditional use zoning districts, and overlay zoning districts and transitional zoning regulations, in addition to general use districts. 
It is the purpose and intent of this section to permit the City to create, through the legislative process, general use districts, in which a variety of uses are permitted; conditional use districts, in which limited uses are permitted only upon approval by the City; and overlay zoning districts, which are applied coincidental with a general or conditional use district. Said overlay zoning districts may impose additional regulations on some property within the underlying general or conditional use district and not on all properties within those districts. 
A person petitioning for rezoning of a tract of land where conditional use districts or overlay districts are authorized by ordinance, may elect to request a general use district, a conditional use district, or an overlay district for the tract. 
If the petitioner elects to petition for the general use or overlay district zoning, and if the petition is approved, the rezoned property may be used for any of the uses permitted in the applicable general use or overlay district. If the petitioner elects to petition for conditional use district zoning, the petition must specify the actual use or uses, and all other development regulations authorized by State law, which are intended for the property specified in the petition. The intended use or uses and development regulations must be permitted in the corresponding general use district. If the petition is for conditional use district zoning, the City Council is to approve or disapprove the petition on the basis of the specific use or uses and development regulations requested. 
(c)	Such regulations shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan and designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements. Such regulations shall be made with reasonable consideration, among other things, as to the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout such municipality. 
(d)	The City Council shall by ordinance provide for the manner in which such regulations and restrictions and the boundaries of such districts shall be determined, established and enforced, and from time to time amended, supplemented or changed. No such regulation, restriction or boundary or any amendment, supplement or change therein shall become effective until the same shall have been submitted to the City Planning Commission for its recommendations and until such recommendations have been made to the City Council, and until after a public hearing in relation thereto shall be held by and before the City Council at which parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. A notice of such public hearing shall be published once a week for two (2) successive calendar weeks, immediately preceding the date of such hearing, in a newspaper published in the City and qualified to publish legal advertising, said notice to be published the first time not less than fifteen days prior to the date fixed for said hearing. 
(e)	Such regulations, restrictions and boundaries may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, modified or repealed. In case, however, of a protest against such change filed at or before the public hearing by the governing body of the municipality, required to be held by G.S. 160-175 (G.S. 160A-381385), and signed by the owners of twenty per cent or more of the area of the lots included in such proposed change, or of those immediately adjacent thereto, either in the rear, in the front, or on either side thereof extending one hundred feet therefrom, or of those directly opposite thereto across a street therefrom, extending one hundred feet from the street frontage of such opposite lots, such amendment shall not become effective except by a favorable vote of three-fourths of all the members of the City Council. The provisions of this section relative to public hearings and official notice shall apply equally to all changes or amendments. 
(f)	The City Planning Commission shall have power to make recommendations concerning the boundaries of the various districts and appropriate regulations to be enforced therein. The City Planning Commission shall hold public hearings on proposed regulations, restrictions and boundaries, and proposed amendments, changes and modifications therein before submitting its final report thereon to the City Council, and the City Council shall not take action until it has received the final report of the City Planning Commission. 
(S.L. 1953, Ch. 194, §1; S.L. 1959, Ch. 812, §1; S.L. 1985, Ch. 49, §1)
Amendment note: 1985 Session Laws, Ch. 49, §1, amended §100(h) of Ch. 1184 Session Laws 1949, subsection (b) of this section, by replacing the period after the last sentence with a semicolon and adding the remaining language in that paragraph and adding the next three paragraphs in that subsection. 
Sec. 6.40 SAMEBOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.

The City Council is authorized to create a fund to be known as the perpetual care fund for the cemetery or cemeteries, for the purpose of perpetually caring for and beautifying the cemetery or cemeteries, and said fund shall be kept by the City as is provided for bequests and gifts for cemetery purposes; and the City Council may make contracts with plat or space owners in the cemetery or cemeteries, obligating the City to keep up and maintain said lots or spaces, in perpetuity, upon payment of such sum or sums as may be fixed by the City Council; and the City Council is further authorized and empowered to accept gifts and bequests for such purposes, or upon such other trusts as the donors may prescribe; and the City Council is authorized to set aside for said perpetual care fund an amount not exceeding twenty-five (25) per cent of the proceeds of sale of cemetery lots. The principal of said funds so appropriated by the City Council for the caring for the cemetery or cemeteries shall be held by the City Council for caring for and beautifying the cemetery or cemeteries, and improving the same. The income from the said fund heretofore or hereafter made shall be used for such purpose of carrying out contracts with the individual plat or space owners for perpetual care of individual plats and spaces. Any gift heretofore or hereafter made to and received by the City, or any of its officers, shall be held and used as a sacred trust fund for the purpose and upon the conditions named in such gifts or bequests, and any and all such funds shall be kept or invested separate and shall not be used for any other purpose, or by the City in its other affairs. The City Treasurer shall keep a separate account of the cemetery funds, and a still further separate account of all special gifts or bequests made by persons for and in connection with the cemetery or cemeteries, and particular lots therein. The City Council shall have the power to make rules and regulations and adopt ordinances for the carrying out of the duties imposed by this section. 
Sec. 6.42 TAXATION.
(a)	It shall be the power of the City of Raleigh and the duty of the City Council of the City of Raleigh, annually, to levy taxes that will raise sufficient funds for the operation and management of the affairs of the City, and shall levy and collect the same in accordance with the provisions as now or may hereafter exist under the general laws of the State of North Carolina; and said City shall have the further power to levy and collect such further taxes as may be approved by a vote of the electorate, and in accordance with such authority with respect thereto as may now or hereafter be granted to said City; provided, all polls and property taxable within the City of Raleigh shall be listed and valued and all property assessed as provided for in the listing, valuation and assessing of the same under the laws which may now or hereafter be applicable to Wake County and/or the City of Raleigh, and said City may levy and collect such license and privilege taxes as may be provided by law and ordinances of the City Council. 
(b)	The ad valorem taxes levied by the City of Raleigh shall constitute a lien upon personal and real property, as provided by the general laws of the State of North Carolina, as the same may now or hereafter be enacted, and the City of Raleigh shall enforce and perfect the same upon personal and real property under the provisions and procedure which may now or hereafter be outlined and provided for in the general laws of the State of North Carolina; provided, further, that in the event that the City of Raleigh shall become the purchaser and owner of any real property in the enforcement of such tax liens, said real property so acquired may be sold at public sale at any time thereafter by the City of Raleigh. 
Sec. 6.43 CONDEMNATION POWERS AND PROCEDURES.
(a)	In addition to the foregoing powers and as alternative powers and methods of procedure for the exercise of the power of eminent domain, the City of Raleigh is hereby authorized to use, in the exercise of the power of eminent domain for any lawful purpose, the procedure and authority prescribed in Article 9 of Chapter 136 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, as now or hereafter amended; provided, that whenever therein the words "commission" or "highway commission" or "state highway commission" appear, they shall be deemed to include the "City of Raleigh," and whenever therein the words "director," "Chairman," or "Director of Highways" or "Director of the Highway Commission" or "Chairman of the Highway Commission" appear, they shall be deemed to include the "City Manager."

(S.L. 1955, Ch. 145, §1; S.L. 1973, Ch. 319, §1(u))
Editor's note: 1981 Session Laws, Ch. 919, repealed the grant of condemnation authority set out above and instituted uniform eminent domain procedures for all municipalities, codified as Chapter 40A of the General Statutes. 1991 Session Laws, Ch. 312, §1, which amends §2.14(32), restored the right of the City to use G.S. Ch. 136 condemnation procedures.

CHAPTER 4. STORMWATER SERVICES
Sec. 6-4001. FINDINGS.
(a)	Stormwater poses a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare because if unmanaged it floods properties, erodes watercourses and channels, and pollutes streams and rivers. 
(b)	By mapping, planning, constructing, operating, cleaning, regulating and maintaining the natural and constructed stormwater management system, the City reduces the adverse effects of stormwater and improves the quality of groundwater, streams, rivers, and lakes in and around the City. 
(c)	Providing a stable source of funding for stormwater services, as hereafter defined, can best be accomplished through stormwater management utility funds. Such a utility will benefit owners and occupants of developed land in the City and other Raleigh citizens. 
(d)	The amount of impervious surface on a property is the single most important factor affecting the peak rate of runoff, the total volume discharged, and pollutant loadings of stormwater that flows from property. 
State law reference: Authority to adopt a stormwater management utility, Chapter 160A, Article 16. 
(Ord. No. 2003-537, §3, 11-5-03)
Sec. 6-4002. DEFINITIONS.
All definitions as used in this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, shall have the meaning given herein: 
Customer or consumer means the person or entity to which a bill for stormwater service charges is sent. 
Developed land means real property that contains impervious surfaces, and includes improved land without structures and land on which improvements are under construction. 
Dwelling unit means one (1) or more rooms physically arranged to create an housekeeping establishment with separate facilities for cooking, sleeping and toilet for occupancy by one (1) or more persons.
Impervious surface means any surface which because of its material composition or compacted nature impedes or prevents natural infiltration of stormwater into the soil. Impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, roofs, roof extensions, patios, balconies, decks, including wooden slatted decks, athletic courts, swimming pools, excluding the water area of swimming pools, streets, parking areas, driveways, sidewalks, and any concrete, stone, brick, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces. Ungraveled natural footpaths, water surfaces of lakes streams and swimming pools and drain fields are not impervious surfaces. 
Other residential and nonresidential developed land means any individual lot or parcel of developed land that is not single-family developed land. It includes, but is not limited to, land upon which there are residential structures that contain more than one (1) dwelling unit, such as multi-family dwellings (duplexes and greater), manufactured home park, as defined in Part 10, §10-2002, condominiums, apartments, boarding houses, rooming houses, fraternity houses, sorority houses, dormitories, churches; institutional buildings, whether public or private; hospitals, rest homes, public and private schools, colleges, and universities, commercial, office, hotels and motels, and industrial buildings, storage areas, parking lots and land containing improvements under construction or impervious surfaces. 
Property owner or owner means the owner of a real property as shown on the Wake County tax records. 
Single-family equivalent unit (SFEU) is the median of impervious surface on a single-family (detached home) developed land in the City as established by City Council resolution. 
Single-family developed land means an individual lot or parcel of land developed with only one (1) single-family (attached [townhome] or detached) dwelling unit, one (1) manufactured home, or one (1) mobile home, and the ownership interest of the land and of the dwelling unit are united and identical. Single-family developed landshall not include structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes or other residential and nonresidential developed property. 
Stormwater management service charge is the charge to provide stormwater services to developed property. The charge is based upon the single-family equivalent unit (SFEU) as calculated for that property. 
Stormwater management system or system means the system of natural and constructed devices for collecting and transporting stormwater. It includes, but is not limited to, structural drainage systems such as open swales and ditches, catch basins, pipes, inlets, storm sewers, drains, culverts, junction boxes, and other stormwater management facilities that affect the quality and quantity of stormwater located within dedicated public street rights-of-way and City of Raleigh permanent drainage easements accepted by the City and all natural stormwater drainage systems. 
Stormwater management utility funds mean the stormwater management service charges and the interest generated by those charges. 
Stormwater services means City stormwater management programs designed to protect water quality by controlling the level of pollutants in, and the quantity and flow of, stormwater and City service of structural and natural stormwater and drainage systems of all types. Stormwater services include any cost necessary to assure that all aspects of stormwater quality and quantity are managed in accordance with federal and State laws, regulations and rules, and costs related to the mapping, planning, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection, management and regulation of the stormwater management system and the regulation of impervious surface and stormwater. 
(Ord. No. 2003-537, §3, 11-5-03; Ord. No. 2004-571-TC-243, §§1, 2, 2-17-04)
Sec. 6-4003. CREATION OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT.
All stormwater management service charges and interest generated by such charges, the stormwater management utility funds, shall be placed in a separate City account and shall be used by the City of Raleigh solely for the operational costs, maintenance costs, and management costs, indirect costs, capital improvements, debt principal and debt service, and establishment of a reserve fund for stormwater services. The Citymay use funds that are not stormwater management utility funds to provide stormwater services.
(Ord. No. 2003-537, §3, 11-5-03)
Sec. 6-4004. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SERVICE CHARGES.
(a)	All developed land in the City, whether public or private, shall be subject to a stormwater management service charge. Exemptions shall not be allowed based on age, tax exemption, or other status of an individual or organization. Stormwater management service charges may be subject to a credit system as further provided herein 
(b)	Stormwater management service charges on developed land shall be set forth in the City of Raleigh Fee Schedule. These charges will be determined and modified from time to time by the City Council so that the revenues generated by said charges will be used to pay the principal and the interest on the debt incurred for stormwater purposes, and such expenses as are reasonably necessary for providing stormwater services within the City of Raleigh. 
Cross reference: The amount of impervious surface area for single-family equivalent units, the base rate, the tier structure for single-family developed land and late charges are set forth in Resolution No. (2003)-888. 
(c)	Computation of stormwater management service charges.
For Other residential and nonresidential land, the monthly stormwater management service charges on developed land is calculated by dividing the total impervious surface area of the property divided by one (1) single-family equivalent unit, rounded to the nearest tenth, multiplied by the established monthly single-family equivalent unit rate as fixed by City Council Resolution. 
For developments with common property containing impervious surfaces, such as townhouse developments, cluster unit developments, or condominiums, each dwelling unit shall be responsible for its equal pro rata share of the total impervious surfaces area of the common areas of the development not served by City of Raleigh water or sewer or both unless other arrangements are made pursuant to §6-4006(e). 
(d)	The following exemptions from stormwater management service charges are allowed: 
(1)	Undeveloped land. 
(2)	Improved public streets, not including internal roads within public facilities which have been conveyed to the North Carolina Department of Transportation or City of Raleigh and which are used by the general public for motor vehicle transportation, and private streets constructed in accordance with the Raleigh City Code and City of Raleigh Streets Sidewalks and Driveway Access Handbook. 
(3)	Railroad tracks. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings or other developed land shall not be exempted from stormwater management service charges. 
(4)	Developed land with less than four hundred (400) square feet of impervious surface area. 
(5)	Portions of developed land that directly drain outside the City limits. 
No exemption authorized under subsections (4) and (5) shall be made until a written request to the Chief Engineer of the City documenting the application of the exemption is approved. The Chief Engineer may approve or reject the request in whole or in part. 
(Ord. No. 2003-537, §3, 11-5-03; Ord. No. 2004-571-TC-243, §§3, 4, 2-17-04; Ord. No. 2019-949, §4, 6-4-19, eff. 7-1-19 )
Sec. 6-4005. CREDITS APPLICABLE TO STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SERVICE CHARGES.
(a)	The Citymay provide a system of credits to reduce stormwater management service charges for properties on which stormwater control measures substantially mitigates the peak discharge or runoff pollution flowing from such properties or substantially decreases the City's cost of maintaining the stormwater management system. The Central Engineering Department will develop written policies to implement the credit system. No credit will be authorized until the City Council approves written policies to implement the system of credits; a copy of the approved policies shall be on file with the City Clerk. The City's policies may make credits retroactive to the date stormwater management service charges were initiated. Any bill charges requiring adjustments must be applied through the utility billing system. But no credit will be granted for more than three (3) past years. Nothing shall prevent the City Council from modifying the adopted system of credits, and such modifications may apply to holders of existing credits. 
(b)	Each credit allowed against the stormwater management service charge is conditioned on the continuing operation and functioning of the stormwater control measure as designed; credited stormwater control measures must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations, and credits may be rescinded for noncompliance with these standards. 
(c)	Each credit for which a customer applies shall be subject to review and approval by the Chief Engineer or his designee. The Chief Engineer may approve or reject any application for a credit in whole or in part. 
(d)	Credits shall only be applied to developed lands containing the credited stormwater control measure. For developments with common property containing credited stormwater control measures such as townhouse developments, cluster unit developments, or condominiums, each dwelling unit shall be eligible for its equal pro rata share of the credit unless other arrangements for billing the stormwater management service charge are made pursuant to §6-4006(e). 
(Ord. No. 2003-537, §3, 11-5-03)
Sec. 6-4006. BILLING METHOD, RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.
(a)	Bills for stormwater service shall be sent at regular periodic intervals. Stormwater management service charges may be billed on a combined utility bill that also contains charges for sewer service or combined sewer and water service and/or solid/waste management service. Stormwater management service charges that are shown on a combined utility bill may be for a different service period than that used for sewer service or combined sewer and water service. 
(b)	Stormwater management service charges for a property that receives sewer service or combined sewer and water service will be sent to the customer receiving such service. However, where multiple water and sewer accounts exist for a single parcel, the bill for stormwater management service charges may for good cause shown at the discretion of the City be sent to the property owner. Additional policies concerning billing will be developed by the City. 
(c)	The property owner is ultimately responsible for payment of the stormwater management service charge for property for which the party billed has not paid the stormwater management service charge. 
(d)	Owners of property may, with the consent of the City, designate each occupant of the property as the party to receive the bill for stormwater management service charge by completing and properly executing a form provided by the City. Such designation shall fairly allocate the impervious surfaces actually used by the billed party, and it shall be binding for the period of time specified by the City. No occupant may be designated as the party to receive the bill for stormwater management service charge unless the occupant is also receiving a City sewer service or combined sewer and water service bill. Such transfer does not relieve either the owner or occupant from liability for stormwater management service charges if they are not paid by the party billed. 
(e)	The residents of townhouse, cluster unit, and condominium developments and other similar properties containing impervious surface in common areas may in accordance with this subsection charge the total impervious surface of all commonly-owned or common areas to the homeowners association. The bill for stormwater management service charge will be sent to the homeowners' association upon official request of a majority of all lot or unit owners of the association; provided that (1) the current adopted budget of the association includes this additional charge to the homeowners association, (2) the association is receiving a City sewer service bill or combined sewer and water service bill and (3) a payment bond in the amount of six (6) months estimated bill in favor of the City. Stormwater management service charges applied to all individually-owned property within the development may likewise be billed to the homeowners association. Any request for homeowner association billing must contain all information required by the City and shall be binding for the period of time specified by the City. 
(Ord. No. 2003-537, §3, 11-5-03)
Sec. 6-4007. PAYMENT PROVISIONS; UTILITY TERMINATION.
(a)	Where stormwater management service charges appear on a combined utility bill or a master summary bill, and a customer does not pay the service charges for all the utilities on the bill, the partial payment will be applied to the respective service charges in the following order: delinquent stormwater management service charges, delinquent recycling and/or solid waste management service charges, delinquent sewer service or combined sewer and water charges, current stormwater charges, current recycling and/or solid waste management service charges and current sewer service or combined sewer and water charges. 
(b)	Stormwater management service charges are due at the collection office in City hall within the time period stated on the bill. Bills not paid within this time shall be charged a late fee as set forth in the City of Raleigh Fee Schedule. 
(c)	Where a property receives sewer service or combined sewer and water service, if stormwater management service charges for that property are not paid, sewer service or combined sewer and water service to that propertymay be terminated, whether or not the stormwater management service charges were included on a combined utility bill. Termination will be handled in accordance with standard operation provisions of the City. At least twenty-one (21) days prior to termination of service, the City will post a sign or signs either upon the subject property or at convenient locations as it deems appropriate. Such posting shall advise that City sewer service or combined sewer and water service may be terminated and direct further inquiry to a listed telephone number. All postings are for the convenience of the public and any defective posting shall not invalidate the termination of City utility services. 
(d)	No property for which stormwater management service charges are outstanding is entitled to receive sewer service or combined sewer and water service until the outstanding stormwater management service charge on that property is paid. No customer with a delinquent stormwater management service account is entitled to open a sewer service or a combined sewer and water account at the same or different location until the delinquency has been satisfied. 
(e)	If property is underbilled, or not billed, or a bill is sent to the wrong party, the Citymay backbill up to a three-year period. 
(f)	Customers with complaints about the accuracy of stormwater management service charges are entitled to a review as provided in section 6-4008. No charge will be retroactively adjusted to resolve customer complaints for a period of more than three-year prior to the date the City received the complaint. Any bill charges requiring adjustment must be applied through the utility billing system.

The Chief Engineer may adjust the stormwater service management charge so long as the adjustment is in conformance with the general purpose and intent of this chapter. At the conclusion of the review, the Chief Engineer shall issue a written determination stating whether an adjustment to the stormwater service management charge is appropriate, and if so, the percentage of such adjustment. Any approved adjustments must be communicated in writing to the appropriate utility billing staff. 
(3)	An appeal may be taken from any decision of the Chief Engineer which is adverse to the customer by giving notice of appeal to the City Manager within thirty (30) days after service of the Chief Engineer's written decision on the customer. Notice of appeal shall be given by the customer by delivery of a written statement to the City Manager stating the grounds for the appeal and providing the City Manager with a copy of the written decision of the Chief Engineer. The Chief Engineer shall transmit to the City Manager and the customer all documents constituting the record upon which the Chief Engineer's decision was made. 
(4)	All decisions of the Chief Engineer and City Manager shall be served on the customer personally or by registered or certified mail. Mailing shall be based upon the billing address of the customer. 
(5)	Following the decision of the City Manager, the customermay make an appeal to the City Council. The City Councilshall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal, shall give due notice of such hearing to the customer and the manager, and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. 
(6)	When an appeal is from a decision authorizing an adjustment to the customer's bill, the Chief Engineer's decision shall remain in effect until and unless reversed or otherwise modified.

For new customer accounts, this service application is received in the form of a utility connection permit. For existing utility system service accounts, customers must contact the Utility Billing Office to close or initiate service in the new customer's name. In order to initiate service on a new account or to initiate service on an existing account in the name of a new customer, an utility service initiation charge must be billed to the customer and collected by the City in the customer's first utility bill mailed to the customer. Failure of the customer to pay the full amount of the utility service initiation charge will be treated in the same manner as the utility bill being past due. 
The utility service initiation fee shall be as set forth in the Raleigh Water Fee Schedule. This fee shall be billed by the City Utility Billing office as described in this section. The City's utility system customers are required to pay for their utility service by a date specified on their utility system bill. Failure to pay their bill by this date will result in the addition of a delinquency fee added to the amount past due on their utility bill. The delinquency fee and the past due utility bill amount must be paid in full to the City, in order for the customer's utility account to be considered current. Failure of the customer to pay the full amount of the delinquency fee will be treated in the same manner as the utility bill being past due for the customer's next utility bill and grounds for utility service interruption by the City, if not paid in full in the subsequent utility bill.

(a)	When a duplicating water or sewer service is extended to a lot not at the intersection of two (2) streets but with adequate (eight-inch sewer or six-inch water) existing service within a public utility easement, assessment of the cost of the duplicating service shall be limited to the frontage of the lot abutting the right-of-way or easement in which the duplicating service is installed in excess of one hundred fifty (150) feet. The exemption shall apply to lots having an existing adequate (eight-inch sewer or six-inch water) or greater size water or sewer service main or the right-of-way or easement containing an adequate size water or sewer service main crossing or touching the property subject to assessment. The exemption contained herein shallnot relieve a lot from an additional assessment for the extension of an existing water or sewer line if the existing water or sewer line extends across only a part of the frontage of the lot and assessment has theretofore been made against only that part of the lot abutting on the existing line. 
(b)	Where one (1) or more water or sewer lines traverse a lot or tract of land, the abutting footage for each lot, tract or parcel assessed according to the assessment roll shall not exceed the straight line distance between the beginning point and the ending point of the line or lines. Provided, upon the installation of a duplication service to a traversed lot or tract of land, an exemption of one hundred fifty (150) feet shall be allowed for the duplicating service pursuant to subsection (a) above.

Sec. 8-2036. ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS ON ASSESSMENTS.
(a)	The term "lot" as used in this section is defined as a parcel of land owned by one (1) owner without regard to whether or not shown on any subdivision map as separate lots and without regard to how or when acquired, except that when an assessment is made on a per lot basis in a subdivision, the term "lot" shall apply to each separate subdivided lot or a combination of subdivided lots where a single building unit is constructed on a portion of all the lots. Provided, however, that when a lot in a subdivision abuts a water or sewer line and the lots in the subdivision are assessed on a per lot basis, such lot shall not be assessed a greater amount than the amount which would be assessed against the lot on a linear foot basis after giving credit for the exemptions contained in this section. 
(b)	The exemptions provided for in §§8-2034 and 8-2035shall apply only if the cost of the existing water and sewer service main has been assessed against the property for which a duplicating service is provided, or if the existing water or sewer main, including major mains, was installed by a subdivider of property without cost to the City, or if the cost of the existing water or sewer service main has been paid from community development funds and such mains are located within redevelopment areas as delineated pursuant to Article 22 of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes of North Carolina, as amended.

Sec. 8-2037. CHARGE IN LIEU OF ASSESSMENT ON PROPERTY NOT ASSESSED.
(a)	If property to be served by a water or sewer line is to be connected to a line constructed on an assessment basis pursuant to the provisions of §§8-2031 through 8-2036 of this Code and no assessment was made against the property for its proportionate part of the line because ownership of the property would not permit the collection of an assessment, or the property was not deemed by the City to benefit from the water or sewer lines at the time the water or sewer line was originally constructed, then either at the time of authorized connection or presentation of a subdivision for recordation, whichever occurs first, there shall be collected, in addition to all other charges provided herein, or by other law, or ordinance, or resolution, the amount which would have been assessed against the property to be served by the line had such property been assessable at the time the line was constructed. 
(b)	In those cases where the City has paid the cost of the installation of a water and/or sewer line outside the City, either at the time of connection or presentation of a subdivision for recordation, whichever occurs first, there shall be in addition to all other fees, an amount charged at the time of connection equal to the amount that would have been assessed, if the property had been assessed but was not, due to the fact that property was located outside the City limits at the time the line was installed.

The City shall not be obligated to install facilities to provide gravity sewer service to any floor level of any existing or proposed structure at an elevation lower than ten (10) feet below the crown of the street directly in front of the structure. Notwithstanding this provision, property owners desiring that the line be placed at a depth greater than necessary to serve a floor level ten (10) feet below the crown of the street shall be required to pay the difference in cost of laying such line at that depth and the depth at which the property owner desires the line to be laid. Such cost shall be estimated by the City based on the difference in cost for installing a line at twelve (12) feet of depth and the depth at which the property owner desires the line to be laid. Payment of the estimated cost shall be made within thirty (30) days of the date of the demand for payment or the line will be laid at a depth as if the property owner had not requested that the line be installed at a greater depth. Notwithstanding the payment of the estimated cost of the greater depth of lines, the property owner making the payment shall still be assessed for his proportionate cost of the installation of the line consistent with the normal assessment policy.

Sec. 8-2063. CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL OF OUTSIDE EXTENSIONS.
All utility extensions outside the corporate limits shall be subject to the approval of the City Council. After action has been taken by the Raleigh Director of Public Utilities or his designee (and by the Planning Commission, when required) and recommendations have been made to the Council, the Council shall consider and act upon the question of approving or disapproving the application, and the action of the Council shall be final; provided, however, the Council may indicate to the owners or promoters of any such addition, extension, subdivision, or development the requirements which must be met as a prerequisite for approving the application. 
(a)Streetstandards.
In prescribing such requirements and prerequisites for approval of the application for utility connections, the Council shall, in approving the subdivision or development, determine the width of streets, the adequacy of drainage, and flood control measures and facilities, the type of paving, the size and type of pipes and other equipment, the location of streets, particularly with respect to their coordination with the street plan of the City, and such other matters with respect to the development or subdivision as the Council in its discretion may deem proper. 
(b)Water and sewer lines required.
No private water line, lines or system within any greater than two-acre development or subdivision outside the corporate limits shall be approved for connection with the water system of the City, nor will the City accept any dedication of the same nor will the City agree to furnish water service to consumers within any such development or subdivision, unless, at the same time, there is connected with the City sewerage system and dedicated to the City sewer a sewerage system laid and constructed to City standards sufficient to make available adequate sewerage services for each of the lots within such development or subdivision. No private sewer line, lines, or system within any greater than two-acre development or subdivision outside the corporate limits shall be approved for connection with the sewer system of the City, nor will the City accept any dedication of the same, nor will the City agree to furnish sewer service to consumers within any such development or subdivision, unless, at the same time, there is connected with the City water system and dedicated to the City a water system laid and constructed to City standards sufficient to make available adequate water services for each of the lots within such development or subdivision. On lots greater than two (2) acres that have existing buildings that are having well and septic tank problems, [these] would be able to use one (1) utility without the other if both utilities are not available to the site. 
In such case where both utilities are not available to a particular tract of land and the property owner wishes to connect to the one that is available, the property owner will be allowed to connect to the particular utility that is available. Available for the purpose of this paragraph shall be defined to mean that the utility is located within one thousand (1,000) feet of the nearest point on the property. 
Cross reference:Property owners located outside City limits which connect to one (1) or more City utilities must submit a voluntary petition annexation, Resolution No. 1993-208. 
(c)Adequate flood control facilities required.
The City hereby states a policy of not extending water and/or sewer service facilities, or any other facilities under its control, into areas of Wake County outside the City's Chapter 160A, Article 19 planning jurisdiction, except in unusual circumstances, unless and until areas into which such services are extended and the areas within the Chapter 160A, Article 19 planning jurisdiction of the City are adequately protected through the installation of flood control and other such devices, and unless and until adequate facilities are available for the supply of water and the treatment of sewage. 
Cross reference: Floodprone area regulations, Part 10, Ch. 4. 
(d)Community systems.
Developments located outside the corporate limits but within the utilities planning area as provided in the comprehensive plan that install or propose to install a community water system, sanitary sewer system, or both must install said systems in accordance with the City design, materials, and construction standards and methods. Such design, materials, and construction standards and methods are subject to the same regulations as if the community water and community sewer system were connected to the system of Raleigh. If the conditions of G.S. 160A-374 are met by the City, full dedication of a community water system, including all wells, pumps, and utility lines, is required.

Editor's note: Reimbursements for oversized utility lines are found in Standard Operating Procedure No. 700-6, major mains, §7.2et seq. 
Sec. 8-2096. REIMBURSEMENT PROCEDURES FOR REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING MAINS.
(a)	During the rezoning, development plan, or building permit review process, the Raleigh Director of Public Utilities or his designee may determine that the increase in sewer discharge associated with a project will exceed the available capacity of downstream sewer mains and that replacement of the existing downstream sewer mains is required or that replacement of existing water mains is necessary to facilitate the potable water demands or fire flow requirements for a project. The City's Urban Redevelopment Main Replacement Reimbursement Program will provide reimbursements to developers who are required by the City to replace existing water and sewer mains in association with development projects. Reimbursements under this program may be for replacing water and/or sewer mains to provide adequate pipe capacity, and/or when the City requires the replacement of existing water and sewer infrastructure adjacent to a proposed project based on the condition of the existing pipes. The available reimbursement amount, as a percentage of estimated construction cost, will vary based on the age, condition and available capacity of the existing mains that are being replaced in association with the development project. The highest levels of reimbursement will be provided for projects replacing mains which are old, deteriorated, or over capacity in existing conditions, with the intent of distributing the costs of such projects between developers, the existing customer base, and future developments equitably. The Raleigh Director of Public Utilities shall adopt an Urban Redevelopment Main Replacement Reimbursement Policy pursuant to the requirements and standards set forth in this §8-2096 to implement this program, which shall be approved by the Council and incorporated into this Code by reference. 
(b)	The developer shall identify the proposed increase in sewer capacity associated with the proposed development project. The Raleigh Director of Public Utilities or his designee will determine if there is enough information readily available to ensure that there is adequate downstream capacity for the proposed project. If the City determines there is adequate downstream sewer capacity based on readily available information, no capacity improvements will be required downstream of the project. In the event that not enough information is available, the developer shall be required to provide a sewer capacity study, prepared and sealed by a North Carolina licensed professional engineer, evaluating the downstream sewer capacity. The Raleigh Director of Public Utilities or his designee may require the study to extend to include major interceptors where there is concern that a large project may exceed the capacity of downstream interceptors. 
(c)	Raleigh Director of Public Utilities or his designee may determine that existing mains adjacent to a project require replacement as part of the proposed project due to age or deterioration. Replacement of mains adjacent to a project will only be required when the project will be modifying connections to the existing mains or constructing other improvements, such as street or storm drainage improvements in the right-of-way or easement containing the water and sewer mains. The City will provide 100% reimbursement based on the unit prices set forth in the Raleigh Water Fee Schedule when replacement of the mains is not needed to accommodate additional sewer capacity or water demands or to address conflicts associated with the project. 
(d)	Following the identification by the Raleigh Director of Public Utilities or his designee of mains requiring replacement, the developer shall provide construction drawings for the proposed improvements through the infrastructure construction plan approval process. Prior to construction drawing approval, the developer shall notify the City that an application for reimbursement will be made for the proposed project. The City will determine the applicable reimbursement value based on the criteria described in this section and the Urban Redevelopment Main Replacement Reimbursement Policy. 
(e)	Within one yearfollowing completion of the project and acceptance of utility improvements by the City, a reimbursement contract shall be prepared pursuant to §8-2095 and submitted to Council for approval, and then executed by the City and developer. No reimbursement contract shall be executed by the City until such time as main trunk or interceptor facilities which serve the major mains are operational. Should the developer fail to execute the reimbursement contract within one year of the City's acceptance of the utility improvements, the City shall have no further obligation to reimburse the developer for the cost of the main or interceptor facilities that the developer constructed. 
(f)	The reimbursement amount will be calculated based on the unit costs set forth in the Raleigh Water Fee Schedule and the Urban Redevelopment Main Reimbursement Policy. The City will require that the reimbursement be based on the lowest cost alternative which is feasible for the construction being pursued. If the developer chooses to pursue a higher cost construction method or alignment, the City will reimburse based on the lower cost alternative. (i.e. the developer may choose a more expensive alternative to speed schedule). Reimbursement based on unit costs is intended to cover both design and construction. In the event that the developer believes that actual construction cost will significantly exceed the costs below, the developer may request to be reimbursed according to the amounts and procedures established in the Anomaly Process in §8-2096(g) below. 
(g)	In the event that site conditions exist that may cause construction costs to exceed the published unit costs set forth in the Raleigh Water Fee Schedule, the developer may choose to pursue this Anomaly Process in lieu of applying for reimbursement according to the published costs. The developer shall provide the City with the approved construction drawings and specifications based on the City's standard specifications for Water and Sewer Construction in the Raleigh Public Utilities Handbook. After the developer enters into a contract with the City for payment of the developer's portion of the project costs, the City will initiate a Capital Improvement Project to construct the proposed improvements. The City will bid the proposed water or sewer main replacement project in accordance with North Carolina Law for Public Contracts, N.C.G.S. 143, Article 8 and award the construction contract to the lowest responsible, responsive bidder. The developer shall pay to the City the total amount of the developer's portion of the proposed construction costs prior to contract award based on the low bid construction cost and the Reimbursement Percentages calculated above. The City will administer the construction of the proposed main replacement. Upon project completion, the final project cost shall be determined including approved change orders. The developer's portion of the project cost shall be based on the actual final project cost. The Developer may choose to pursue building permits following the bid opening, however no Certificate of Occupancy will be provided until all required improvements have been completed and accepted by the City. The City does not guarantee the project will meet the Developer's schedule. 
(h)	Projects which were approved for construction prior to effective date of this ordinance but which have not yet been accepted for ownership by the City are eligible to apply for reimbursement under this §8-2096.

No industrial user shall discharge any hazardous wastes without notification to and approval by the POTW Director. 
(a)	Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days before the discharge commences. The user shall not begin the discharge until receipt of written approval from the City. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under §8-2132 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§8-2128, 8-2130, and 8-2131 of this article. 
(b)	Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)	In the case of any new regulation under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)	In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)	This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued there under, or any applicable Federal or State law. 
(Ord. No. 2011-981, §1, 12-6-11)
Sec. 8-2137. ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.

Sec. 8-2176. VOLUNTARY WATER USE MEASURES.
All consumers are encouraged to adopt the following best management practices to conserve water: 
(a)Outdoor Water Uses:
1.	It is recommended that all irrigation systems which use water from the public water supply should be operated in the following manner: 
a.	Properties with ODD numbered addresses water lawns and landscapes on TUESDAY, THURSDAY and SATURDAY. 
b.	Properties with EVEN numbered addresses water lawns and landscapes on WEDNESDAY, FRIDAY and SUNDAY. 
Automatic or non-automatic irrigation systems should only be operated between the hours of 12:00:01 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. and hose end sprinklers should be operated only between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. and also 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. No automatic or non-automatic irrigation systems or hose end sprinklers should be operated on MONDAY. Automatic or non-automatic irrigation systems and hose end sprinklers should be operated in a manner to prevent water waste so as to avoid watering impervious surfaces such as streets, parking lots, driveways and sidewalks at all times. 
2.	Check for plumbing leaks. A single dripping faucet can waste hundreds, even thousands, of gallons per year. Most water leaks are easy to detect and repair with basic plumbing skills and a few simple tools. 
3.	Have soil tested by the North Carolina Department of Agronomy/Soil Testing Section. Most yards in this region are composed of granite soils. They need lime more than they need fertilizer. 
4.	Plant native trees and shrubs. The North Carolina State University Cooperative Extension Service has excellent suggestions for home gardeners. Use mulch around shrubs and garden plants to reduce evaporation. Mix the turf areas with shaded areas to reduce irrigation demands. 
5.	Let the grass grow taller in hot weather by raising your lawn mower cutting height. Longer grass blades help shade each other, reduce evaporation, and inhibit weed growth. 
6.	Water slowly and thoroughly during cool, windless hours to prevent water loss from evaporation. 
7.	Be attentive if using a hose and sprinkler, consider setting an alarm or the oven timer as a reminder to move the hose and sprinkler as needed. 
8.	Use a rain gauge. One (1) inch of water per week will keep lawns green throughout the summer. 
9.	Water should be applied slowly to achieve deep penetration and prevent water run-off. 
10.	Do not water impervious surfaces such as streets, parking lots, driveways and sidewalks. 
11.	Install a drip irrigation system for watering gardens, trees, and shrubs. Drip systems are very efficient because they provide a slow, steady trickle of water to plants at their roots through a network of hidden pipes and hoses. 
12.	Use properly treated reuse water for irrigation as an alternative water source. Raleigh's water conservation rules do not regulate the amount of reuse water and therefore any amount can be used during any mandatory water conservation stage. Contact the Raleigh Public Utilities Department for information regarding reuse water availability. 
13.	Capture rain water in cisterns and rain barrels. The average rainfall in the Raleigh area is about forty-eight (48) inches per year. Run-off from the roof of a typical two thousand five hundred (2,500) square foot home is about seventy-five thousand (75,000) gallons a year. Raleigh encourages customers to capture rainwater and use it on the landscape. 
14.	Consider the amount of water being used and look for ways to use less whenever possibly. Do not leave water running - use spring loaded or other automatic shut-off devices on hoses or outdoor faucets. 
15.	Use commercial vehicle washing facilities, especially those which have been certified by Raleigh as water conserving facilities, instead of washing vehicles at home. 
16.	Use a broom or blower to remove dust, dirt, leaves and other debris from sidewalks, driveways, porches and decks rather than water. 
(b)Indoor Water Uses:
1.	Thaw frozen food in your refrigerator or microwave instead of using running water. Wash fruits and vegetables with a vegetable brush in a basin or bowl instead of using running water. 
2.	Scrape or wipe, rather than rinse, dishes before loading into the dishwasher. Wash only full loads. Consider replacing old dishwasher with a water and energy saving model. 
3.	Wash only full loads of laundry or use the appropriate water level or load size selection on the washing machine. Presoak heavily soiled items. Use detergent sparingly in order to avoid rinsing more than normal cycle. Consider purchasing a high efficiency washing machine to save laundry water and energy. 
4.	Install low-flow toilets, faucet aerators, and low-flow showerheads. 
5.	Leaky toilet can waste two hundred (200) gallons of water per day. To detect leaks in a toilet, add a few drops of food coloring to the tank water. Do not flush. Wait a few minutes. The toilet is leaking if the colored water appears in the bowl. 
6.	Commercial and industrial customers not otherwise regulated as a major water user should review their water uses and should consider implementing industry specific best management water conservation practices. 
7.	Check for leaks in toilets, faucets, shower heads and any other plumbing fixtures and repair these leaks immediately.

CHAPTER 8. TREES AND VEGETATION34
Sec. 9-8001. PURPOSE AND INTENT.
(a)	The purpose of this chapter and the City Tree Manual, which is hereby incorporated into this chapter by reference, is to regulate and control the planting of trees and vegetation, to encourage the protection of existing trees and vegetation on the streets and public and private grounds within the City, and to establish the standard arboricultural specifications and practices for existing and future trees and vegetation in the City and on City-owned property outside the corporate limits.

Children may be moved into a seat belt when they reach age eight (8) or eighty (80) pounds, whichever comes first. If a lap/shoulder belt is not available for a child who weighs more than forty (40) pounds, a properly fitted lap belt may be used, since booster seats should not be used with lap-only belts. North Carolina State law also requires that car seats be installed in the rear seat if the child is less than five (5) years old and weighs less than forty (40) pounds, and if vehicle has a passenger side airbag and a rear seat, unless the car seat is specifically designed for use with air bags.

No lettering or numbers shall be acceptable which have been painted upon a sheet of metal or other material which in turn can be removed or detached to conceal the identification of such cab company and cab number, provided that an owner who operates under the name of another ownermay use the same color scheme as such other owner. 
(c)	No vehicle covered by the terms of this chapter shall be licensed nor shall a permit be issued for any vehicle whose color scheme, identifying design, monogram or insignia to be used thereon shall conflict with or imitate any color scheme, identifying design, monogram or insignia used on a vehicle or vehicles already operating under a permit issued pursuant to this article, in such a manner as to be misleading or tending to deceive the public; provided, after a license or permit has been issued for a taxicab hereunder, if the color scheme, identifying design, monogram or insignia thereof is changed so as to be in conflict with or imitate any existing approved color scheme, identifying design, monogram or insignia used by any other owner in such a manner as to be misleading or tending to deceive the public, the license of or permit covering such taxicab or taxicabs shall be suspended or revoked. 
(d)	It is a violation of this article for any owner to engage in false or misleading marketing or advertising included but not limited to the use of the name or color scheme of a competing taxi company licensed under the provisions of this article. 
(e)	In lieu of paint, any material required by this section to be painted on a taxicab may be placed on the cab through the use of an adhesive decal containing the required information and name.

Measurements shall be taken in accordance with section 12-5002 of the City Code. Ten (10) readings above the allowed decibel limits attributed to the sound source or sources shall constitute prima facie evidence of a violation. The sound meter operator may cease taking readings as soon as the readings already taken show a violation. It shall not be necessary to complete all one hundred (100) readings if a fewer number have already indicated a violation of the ordinance. 
(d)	Except as otherwise provided in this section, HDEP permittees shall comply with limitations on sound set out in section 12-2119(c), 12-5006, and 12-5007(a), (b), and (d) through (p).

Repeated failure of the manager to speak with or otherwise respond to residents or non-resident neighbors within a reasonable time after a phone call that occurs when the establishment is open, occupied, or when employees are on site shall constitute a violation of this section. For purposes of this subsection, a failure is repeated when it occurs on three (3) or more days in any calendar month. 
(h)	If requested to do so by the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee, HDEPpermittees should engage in mediation with residents or with non-resident neighbors. Residents, or non-resident neighborsmay decline to participate in mediation; however, willingness to participate in mediation on the part of the permittee is a requirement of issuance of an HDEP. To the extent possible, mediation shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules Implementing Statewide Mediated Settlement Conferences in Superior Court Civil Actions. Unless the parties to mediation otherwise agree and pay the costs of mediation, the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee shall appoint a mediator to conduct the mediation.

Any establishment that has maintained a nine (9) month history of safe and effective operation shall be exempt from the security requirement. Safe and effective operation means that the establishment, either inside or in its parking area or lot, has had less than two (2) custodial arrests for felony drug offenses; less than seven (7) custodial arrests for misdemeanor drug offenses; less than two (2) custodial arrests for acts of violence; or no custodial arrests for acts of violence involving a deadly weapon. The persons arrested must be patrons of the establishment or on their way into or out of the establishment before the arrest limits will apply. For purposes of this ordinance a custodial arrest means a physical arrest that result in a finding of probable cause by a magistrate or judge. The City Manager will implement a system within the City administration to monitor such arrests and probable cause determinations. The safe and efficient requirement shall be retroactive to January 1, 2005. Any establishment that becomes subject to the security requirement can become exempt again if it operates in a safe and efficient manner for nine (9) months from the time it is placed into the program. No security will be required on days when the establishment is not providing amplified entertainment. Any establishment that applies for and receives a new HDEP after the effective date of this ordinance will be presumed to be a safe and efficient operator and will not be required to implement the security requirement until it fails to meet the safety requirements of this section. The security requirement will be waived if the establishment presents satisfactory evidence to the City showing that the parking area is leased from a third party who maintains personnel at the lot or deck or garage at all times during the establishment's hours of operation and that the personnel on duty have a wireless phone, radio, land line phone or other communications device capable of calling the 911 emergency number.

ARTICLE G. PROBATIONARY RENTAL OCCUPANCY PERMIT46
Sec. 12-2162. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF NECESSITY.
(a)	Findings: Housing in the City consists of owner occupied and tenant occupied properties and the two types of housing are in general parity. The substantial majority of complaints about and violations of the Code provisions adopted to assure minimum adequate housing arise from tenant occupied property. State law and this Code impose the responsibility to provide minimally adequate housing for tenants on the property owner. Existing remedial measures in the Code are insufficient to achieve prompt Code compliance resulting in significant adverse impacts on the public health, safety, and welfare of the City including the quality of life for tenants, affected neighborhoods and the City. To expedite compliance with the Code at such properties and thereby assure better quality housing for tenants and the neighborhood, the Council finds it necessary to adopt additional remedial measures for more effective compliance with the Code at such properties. 
(b)	Declaration of necessity: It is deemed necessary in order to promote public health, welfare, good order and safety of the City and its residents that persons renting residential properties where there exist certain unsafe building, minimum housing, zoning or nuisance Code violations should be subject to a permitting system. Permitting will: 
(a)	Reduce the likelihood that these residential housing accommodations will become public nuisances in violation of G.S. 19-1(b). 
(b)	Promote responsible management of these housing accommodations. 
(c)	Assist in providing a safe habitat for residents and neighbors of these facilities. 
(d)	Safeguard property values. 
(e)	Reduce the likelihood that housing accommodations where such problems most frequently have arisen and which are unfit for human habitation, dangerous, or injurious to the public will exist or be occupied. 
(f)	Expedite repair of residential housing accommodations where such problems arise.

Sec. 12-2164. PERMITTING OF PROBATIONARY RENTAL RESIDENTIAL DWELLINGS.
(a)	Unless compliance with this article is deemed pursuant to §12-2166, it shall be unlawful for an owner to rent, to receive rental income from, or to offer for rent, any probationary rental residential dwelling required to be permitted under this part without first obtaining a permit for the dwelling under this part or when the permit issued under this part is revoked. The owner of a probationary rental residential dwelling shall hold a permit under this part for each probationary rental residential dwelling and shall abide by the Standards in §12-2165 in order to be eligible to retain the permit. Each probationary rental residential dwelling is a separate dwelling for fee purposes and for the requirement to be permitted. When an apartment house consisting of multiple dwelling units is required to have a probationary rental occupancy permit as a result of a violation which applies to the building as a whole, a single permit will be required for the building as a whole which permit will be issued to the owner of the building, however each dwelling unit within the building which separately qualifies as a probationary rental residential dwelling shall be subject to separate permit fees and the requirement to be permitted. The Department of Inspections shall assign violations in common areas of an apartment complex to the apartment house nearest to the common area where the violation occurred. 
(b)	Every application for the probationary rental occupancy permit prescribed herein, or a permit amendment to add another probationary rental residential dwelling to the permit, shall be upon a form approved by the Director of the Inspections Department and shall be filed with the Inspections Department. Every application shall be made under oath and shall contain the information required to show the owner is eligible for a permit under this article and sufficient information to enable the Inspections Department to determine that the standards of §12-2165 are being, or will be, met at any probationary rental residential dwelling to be permitted. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete application and a non-refundable application fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00), the Inspections Department shall review each application and determine whether the application should be approved. The Inspections Department shall deny any application which does not satisfy the minimum requirements of this article and any application submitted by an owner during a period of permit revocation. 
(c)	The permit fee shall be three hundred dollars ($300.00) for the first year of the permit. The annual fee for subsequent years shall be five hundred dollars ($500.00). Such fee shall be due and payable when the permit issues with annual fees for subsequent years due and payable annually. 
(d)	Any person required to have a probationary rental occupancy permitshall be permitted for two (2) years. If a violation of the permit occurs, the permit requirement is extended for the probationary rental residential dwelling covered by the permit for two (2) years following the date of the violation. To be released from the requirement for a probationary rental occupancy permit, the owner must have had no violation of any of the Code provisions listed in §12-2163(l) and the standards in §12-2165 for the two (2) year period immediately before the permit period ends and the dwelling must be approved as compliant with the Code in a final inspection. Final inspections will be conducted only upon the request of the owner. When the owner fails to request an inspection within ninety (90) days after the date the permit requirement was due to expire, the Department of Inspections, after written notice to the owner and tenant, shall inspect the permitted dwelling for compliance with the Code provisions listed in §12-2163(l) and the standards in §12-2165. 
(e)	Any person taking title to a permitted probationary rental residential dwelling shall be the holder of the probationary rental occupancy permit. Any person taking title to a probationary rental residential dwelling not previously holding a permit shall apply for a probationary rental occupancy permit. The new owner of the dwelling unit, who is not a prior owner or related by marriage or within the fifth degree of kinship to the seller, may request that the Director of the Inspections Department remove the requirement that the dwelling have a probationary rental occupancy permit. For the request to be eligible for consideration, the new owner must:

(d)	Any person who has been designated as a process service agent and is not the record owner of the probationary rental residential dwelling shall be deemed compliant with this article upon promptly notifying the Inspections Department that the notice or order delivered for service cannot be delivered to the owner and upon filing with the Inspections Department an affidavit or other notarized statement that the agency relationship has been terminated and that all prior notices and orders were delivered to the owner.

No ownermay obtain relief for more than two (2) violations in any three (3) year period per dwelling under this subsection.

(f)	Any mortgagee of record, not otherwise defined as an owner, shall be deemed compliant with this article unless and until the other owners of the probationary rental residential dwelling fail to comply with notices of violations or orders, including for the payment of civil penalties.

ARTICLE H. RENTAL DWELLING REGISTRATION AND PROP NOTIFICATION
Sec. 12-2175. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF NECESSITY.
(a)	Findings: Housing in the City consists of owner occupied and tenant occupied properties and the two types of housing are in general parity. The substantial majority of complaints about and violations of the Code provisions adopted to assure minimum adequate housing arise from tenant occupied property. State law and this Code impose the responsibility to provide minimally adequate housing for tenants on the property owner. A significant obstacle to effecting prompt and efficient enforcement of the minimum housing code is accuracy of the information in the public record for making contact with the owner of such tenant occupied properties and for the delivery of notifications of activity at the property which may result in the dwelling being required to be licensed under Article G, the Probationary Rental Occupancy Permit. In addition, the effectiveness of responses by the Fire Department and the Police Department to multiple incidents at such properties can be improved by contact with the owners or managers of such properties. Existing contact information is insufficient to achieve prompt City response to matters adversely impacting the public health, safety, and welfare of the City including the quality of life for tenants, affected neighborhoods and the City. To expedite Fire and Police response as well as compliance with the Code at such properties and thereby assure better quality housing for tenants and the neighborhood, the Council finds it necessary to adopt a registration requirement for residential rental properties. 
(b)	Declaration of necessity: It is deemed necessary in order to promote public health, welfare, good order and safety of the City and its residents that persons renting residential properties should be subject to a registration system. Registration will: 
(1)	Promote responsible management of these housing accommodations. 
(2)	Assist in providing a safe habitat for residents and neighbors of these facilities. 
(3)	Safeguard property values. 
(4)	Expedite repair of residential housing accommodations where such problems arise.

Sec. 12-5002. MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES.
(a)	Noise measurements shall be made at the property line of the property where the noise to be measured is being generated. If measurement on private property is not possible or practical, noise measurements may be made at the boundary of the public right-of-way which adjoins the complaining property. Such noise measurements shall be made at a height of at least four (4) feet above the ground and at a point approximately ten (10) feet away from walls, barriers, obstructions (trees, bushes, etc.) on a sound level meter operated on the "A" weighting network (scale). In the case of noises within multi-family or multi-tenanted structures, noise measurements shall be made in the complaining unit at a height of at least four (4) feet above the floor and at a point approximately equi-distant from all walls on a sound level meter operated on the "A" weighting network (scale). 
(b)	No individual other than the operators shall be within ten (10) feet of the sound level meter during the sample period. 
(c)	Sound measurements shall be conducted at that time of day or night when the suspect noise source is emitting sound. 
(d)	The sound level measurement shall be determined as follows: 
(1)	Calibrate the sound level meter within one (1) hour before use. 
(2)	Set the sound level meter on the "A" weighted network at slow response. 
(3)	Set the omnidirectional microphone in an approximately seventy-degree position in a location which complies with subsections (a) and (b) above. The operator of the sound level meter shall face the noise source and record the meter's instantaneous response (reading) observed at consecutive ten-second intervals until one hundred (100) readings are obtained. 
(4)	Recalibrate the sound level meter after use. 
(e)	It shall be unlawful for any person to interfere, through the use of sound or otherwise, with the taking of sound level measurements. Violation of this section is a misdemeanor and may also be enforced pursuant to §12-5011 or a combination of remedies.

If the property destroyed, injured or damaged is a motor vehicle or other vehicular equipment, or equipment accessory thereto, it shall be the responsibility of the head of the department or division having control or supervision of such property to cause an immediate report of the damages to be made to the superintendent of shops, who shall immediately make or cause to be made an inspection of the property and an estimate of the damages and the cost of repairs. As soon as practicable thereafter, the superintendent of shops shall make and forward to the City Attorney a written report of such property damages, setting forth the amount thereof and the circumstances under which they resulted. 
(Code 1959, §2-40)
Sec. 14-2003. REPORT TO CITY ATTORNEY.

In the event that the person, firm or corporation causing the destruction, injury or damage shall fail or refuse to make payment to the City of the damages sustained, the City Attorney is authorized and directed to file in the name of the City a civil action against such person, firm or corporation for the recovery of damages, if in the opinion of the City Attorney the amount involved is sufficient to justify the prosecution of a suit and if in the opinion of the City Attorney there is a reasonable probability of obtaining and collecting a judgment against such person, firm or corporation.

The amount of compensation shall in no event be less than the actual cost of repairs to the property damaged, if the property is repairable, nor less than the difference between the reasonable market value of the property immediately before the damages and the reasonable market value or salvage value of the property immediately thereafter, if destroyed or damaged beyond repair. No amount less than that hereinbefore prescribed shall be accepted on behalf of the City in settlement of liability unless authorized in writing by the finance committee of the Council. 
(Code 1959, §2-43)
Sec. 14-2006. EXECUTION OF RELEASE.
When payment has been received and accepted in accordance with the provisions of this article, the Mayor and the City Clerk, or the City Clerk acting alone, shall have full power and authority to execute in the name of and on behalf of the City a written release of liability in favor of the person claimed by the City to have been responsible for the damages, the form of release to be approved by the City Attorney. 
(Code 1959, §2-44)
Sec. 14-2007. REPAIR OF DAMAGED PROPERTY.
Repairs to property damaged shall be made by the proper employee of the City whenever practicable. Repairs shall not be made by persons other than the City, except upon express authority from the Council when the estimated cost of repairs is one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more, or except upon the written authority of the City Manager when the estimated cost thereof is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00); in either case, competitive bids shall be requested and the repair work awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. 
(Code 1959, §2-45)
